# Gokada Delivery Optimization

## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing the location of delivery drivers for Gokada, the largest last-mile delivery service in Nigeria. The aim is to reduce the number of unfulfilled delivery requests by leveraging causal inference, machine learning, and optimization techniques to recommend optimal driver placements.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains datasets used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and model development.
- `src/`: Source code for data processing, modeling, and optimization.
- `env/`: Virtual environment for package dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gokada-delivery-optimization.git
   cd gokada-delivery-optimization



2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    Copy code
    python -m venv env
    Activate the virtual environment:

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    Copy code
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage
## Data Preprocessing
Preprocess the data by running the scripts in the notebooks/ directory. These notebooks include data cleaning, feature engineering, and merging datasets for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Use the notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to perform EDA and visualize patterns in the data.

## Causal Inference
Build and validate causal graphs to identify the primary causes of unfulfilled requests. The causal inference analysis can be found in the notebooks/ directory.

## Machine Learning
Train machine learning models to predict delivery outcomes and optimize driver placements. Notebooks for model training and evaluation are located in the notebooks/ directory.

## Optimization
Solve the driver placement problem using optimization techniques. The optimization code is located in the src/ directory.

## Results
The results of the analysis, including visualizations, model performance, and optimization outcomes, are documented in the notebooks/ directory. Detailed visualizations and figures are available in the interactive web-based visualizations.
